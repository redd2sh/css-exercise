Margin and Padding Practice

- Div One and Div Three have 32px between their text and border (by using padding).
- Div One had 12px between it and any other element on the page (by using margin).
- There is a 48px gap between Div Two and Div Three (by using margin-bottom).
- Div Three is aligned to the right (by using margin-left:auto;).
